Cross Chain Arbitrage Hook

A Uniswap V4 hook that enables seamless cross-chain arbitrage, leveraging pre-bridged single-sided liquidity and an off-chain bot to optimize swap prices across Ethereum L2s, empowering swappers and liquidity providers while balancing the DeFi ecosystem.

Overview

The Cross Chain Arbitrage Hook integrates cross-chain arbitrage directly into Uniswap V4 pools, allowing users to capitalize on price differences across Ethereum Layer 2 networks (e.g., Arbitrum, Base) without bridging delays. An off-chain trusted bot identifies the best prices, and pre-bridged single-sided liquidity ensures fast, frictionless swaps. This redistributes arbitrage value to swappers and LPs, fostering a more efficient and balanced DeFi ecosystem.

Liquidity fragmentation across Ethereum L2s creates price discrepancies, which arbitrage bots exploit, leaving swappers and liquidity providers (LPs) with less value. The Cross Chain Arbitrage Hook solves this by embedding cross-chain arbitrage into Uniswap V4 pools, enabling seamless, cost-effective swaps with pre-bridged liquidity and redistributing profits to users while balancing pricing across chains.

Seamless Cross-Chain Swaps: Executes arbitrage within Uniswap V4 pools using pre-bridged liquidityâ€”no bridging delays.
Value Redistribution: Swappers get better prices, and LPs earn from cross-chain trades, reducing arbitrage bot dominance.
Ecosystem Balance: Helps balance pricing and liquidity across L2s, strengthening DeFi efficiency.
